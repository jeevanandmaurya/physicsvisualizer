Hybrid Showcase - Physics + Non-Physics Combined

This scene demonstrates the perfect integration of physics and non-physics systems:

PHYSICS OBJECTS:
- Multiple bouncing spheres with different velocities
- Spring-constrained pendulums (2 different configurations)
- Ball interacting with animated platform
- All with real-time collision detection

NON-PHYSICS OBJECTS:
- Orbital system (central body + 3 orbiters)
- Pulsing backdrop rings with opacity animation
- Animated floating platform
- Wave pattern spheres (6 objects in phase)
- All with custom JavaScript animations

VISUAL ANNOTATIONS:
Physics objects:
  - Velocity vectors (green)
  - Motion trails (colored by object)
  - Speed labels (real-time)
  - Kinetic energy displays

Non-physics objects:
  - Custom text labels
  - Motion trails
  - Visual identifiers

INTERACTION DEMONSTRATIONS:
1. Physics balls collide and bounce naturally
2. Pendulums swing with spring constraints
3. Platform ball falls onto moving platform
4. Orbiters move in perfect circles
5. Wave pattern creates visual harmony
6. Backdrop rings create depth

ADVANCED FEATURES:
✓ Mixed physics/non-physics objects in same scene
✓ Real-time physics calculations on physics objects
✓ Smooth animations on non-physics objects
✓ Comprehensive visual annotation system
✓ Spring constraints with physics
✓ Custom animation code
✓ Material properties (opacity, metalness)
✓ Motion trails on both object types
✓ Velocity vectors only on physics objects

This scene pushes the limits by combining:
- 6 physics-simulated objects
- 15+ non-physics animated objects
- 20+ visual annotations
- Multiple constraint systems
- Real-time visual feedback
