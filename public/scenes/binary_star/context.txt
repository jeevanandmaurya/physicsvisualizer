Theory:
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

F = G(m₁m₂)/r²

where G is the gravitational constant (6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg² in SI units).

This fundamental law explains:
- Planetary orbits around stars
- Moon's orbit around Earth
- Motion of satellites
- Galaxy formation and structure
- Tides on Earth

Explanation:
This simulation demonstrates a stable circular orbit where a smaller body (planet/satellite) orbits a larger central body (star/planet). The gravitational force provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion.

For a stable circular orbit:
- Gravitational force = Centripetal force
- F_gravity = F_centripetal
- GMm/r² = mv²/r
- Therefore: v_orbital = √(GM/r)

Key observations:
1. **Circular Orbit**: The planet maintains a constant distance from the central body
2. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: L = mvr remains constant
3. **Energy Conservation**: Total energy (KE + PE) remains constant
4. **Orbital Period**: T = 2π√(r³/GM) - Kepler's Third Law
5. **Velocity-Radius Relationship**: Closer orbits require higher speeds

IMPORTANT NOTE:
For stable orbits in this simulation, you need to reduce the Physics Settings → Timestep to 0.001s or lower. The default timestep (0.0166s) can cause numerical integration errors at these scales, leading to orbit decay or instability.

Facts:
- Orbital velocity decreases with increasing orbital radius
- Period increases with orbital radius (T ∝ r^(3/2))
- Total mechanical energy is negative for bound orbits
- Angular momentum L = mvr is conserved
- The orbit is an ellipse (circle is a special case with eccentricity = 0)
- Kepler's Laws emerge from Newton's gravitational law
- The central body also moves slightly (two-body problem)
- Gravitational potential energy: PE = -GMm/r (negative!)
- Escape velocity: v_escape = √(2GM/r) = √2 × v_orbital

Key Equations:
- Universal Gravitation: F = G(m₁m₂)/r²
- Orbital velocity (circular): v = √(GM/r)
- Period (Kepler's 3rd Law): T = 2π√(r³/GM)
- Orbital angular momentum: L = mvr = constant
- Centripetal acceleration: a = v²/r = GM/r²
- Gravitational PE: U = -GMm/r
- Total orbital energy: E = KE + PE = -GMm/(2r)
- Escape velocity: v_esc = √(2GM/r)
- Semi-major axis relation: T² ∝ a³ (Kepler)

Applications:
- Satellite communications and GPS
- Space mission planning
- Planetary science
- Astrophysics and cosmology
- Understanding tides and lunar phases
