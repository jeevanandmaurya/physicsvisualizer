Non-Physics Showcase - Advanced Animations & Visual Effects

This scene demonstrates all non-physics features and animation capabilities:

ANIMATION TYPES:
- Rotation animations (axis-based rotation)
- Scale animations (pulsing effects)
- Position animations (path-based movement)
- Custom code animations (JavaScript-based)

MOTION PATTERNS:
- Circular orbits
- Spiral paths
- Figure-8 trajectories
- Lissajous curves
- Wave patterns
- Helix motion (DNA-like double helix)
- Complex 3D motion

VISUAL EFFECTS:
- Color morphing (HSL color transitions)
- Transparency animations
- Metallic materials (high metalness, low roughness)
- Rough materials (low metalness, high roughness)
- Material property animations

VISUAL ANNOTATIONS:
- Custom text labels on all objects
- Motion trails with various colors
- Trail length variations (60-200 points)
- Multiple line widths

ADVANCED FEATURES:
✓ visualOnly flag for non-physics objects
✓ Custom animation code execution
✓ Real-time property updates
✓ Easing functions for smooth transitions
✓ Loop animations
✓ Material property controls
✓ Opacity/transparency
✓ Complex mathematical motion patterns

All objects are purely visual with no physics simulation, demonstrating the 
full power of the non-physics engine and animation system.
