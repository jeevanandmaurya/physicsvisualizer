Theory:
A simple pendulum consists of a mass (bob) suspended from a fixed point by a massless, inextensible string. It exhibits simple harmonic motion for small angles and demonstrates the principle of conservation of mechanical energy.

The total mechanical energy (E = KE + PE) remains constant in an ideal pendulum with no friction or air resistance.

Explanation:
As the pendulum swings, energy continuously transforms between potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE):

At the highest points:
- Maximum potential energy
- Zero kinetic energy (momentarily at rest)
- All energy is gravitational PE = mgh

At the lowest point:
- Minimum potential energy
- Maximum kinetic energy
- All energy is KE = ½mv²

The pendulum demonstrates:
1. **Conservation of Energy**: Total mechanical energy remains constant
2. **Periodic Motion**: Repeating motion with a fixed time period
3. **Restoring Force**: Gravity provides the force that pulls the bob back toward equilibrium
4. **Harmonic Motion**: For small angles (<15°), the motion is approximately simple harmonic

The period depends only on the length and gravity, NOT on mass or amplitude (for small angles).

Facts:
- Period T = 2π√(L/g) for small angle approximations
- The mass of the bob does NOT affect the period
- Energy continuously converts between kinetic and potential
- At any instant: Total Energy = KE + PE = constant
- Maximum speed occurs at the lowest point
- Acceleration is zero at the lowest point (maximum velocity)
- Acceleration is maximum at the highest points (zero velocity)
- For small angles, the motion is nearly sinusoidal
- The frequency increases with shorter pendulum length
- Galileo discovered that pendulum period is independent of amplitude (isochronism)

Key Equations:
- Period: T = 2π√(L/g)
- Frequency: f = 1/T = (1/2π)√(g/L)
- Angular frequency: ω = √(g/L)
- Potential Energy: PE = mgh = mgL(1 - cosθ)
- Kinetic Energy: KE = ½mv²
- Total Energy: E = KE + PE = constant
- For small angles: θ(t) = θ₀cos(ωt)
- Restoring force: F = -mg sinθ ≈ -mgθ (for small θ)
