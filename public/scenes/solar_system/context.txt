Theory:
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

F = G(m₁m₂)/r²

where G is the gravitational constant.

This simulation demonstrates:
- Planetary orbits around the Sun
- Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
- Conservation of angular momentum
- Orbital velocity calculations
- Moon's orbit around Earth

Orbital Mechanics:
The orbital velocity for a circular orbit is calculated using:
v = √(GM/r)

where:
- G = gravitational constant (1 in simulation units)
- M = mass of central body (Sun: 20000)
- r = orbital radius

Planet Details:
1. Mercury - Innermost planet, fastest orbit (88 Earth days)
   - Orbital radius: 20 units
   - Orbital velocity: 31.62 units/s

2. Venus - Second planet, retrograde rotation
   - Orbital radius: 30 units
   - Orbital velocity: 25.82 units/s

3. Earth - Our home planet with Moon
   - Orbital radius: 40 units
   - Orbital velocity: 22.36 units/s
   - Moon orbital velocity: 28.5 units/s (relative to Sun)

4. Mars - Red planet, potential for life
   - Orbital radius: 55 units
   - Orbital velocity: 19.07 units/s

Kepler's Laws:
1. Law of Orbits: All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus
2. Law of Areas: A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times
3. Law of Periods: The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (T² ∝ r³)

Conservation Laws:
- Angular momentum (L = mvr) is conserved
- Total energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved
- Gravitational potential energy: PE = -GMm/r

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This simulation uses a reduced timestep (0.001s) for numerical stability
- Gravitational physics is enabled with G = 1 (scaled for visualization)
- All planets start in circular orbits with calculated velocities
- Zero friction and restitution to maintain orbital energy
- The Sun is static (infinite mass approximation)

Physics Settings:
- Timestep: 0.001s (critical for orbital stability)
- Solver Iterations: 10
- Gravitational Constant: 1 (scaled)
- Softening: 0.1 (prevents singularities at very close distances)

Educational Value:
Students can observe:
- How orbital velocity decreases with distance from Sun
- Conservation of angular momentum during orbits
- The relationship between mass, distance, and orbital period
- How the Moon maintains orbit around Earth while both orbit the Sun
- Real-time demonstration of Kepler's laws

Tips:
- Pause simulation to measure distances and velocities
- Use graphs to track position and velocity over time
- Compare orbital periods of different planets
- Observe how the Moon's path is perturbed by the Sun's gravity
