Tool-Generated Content Showcase

This scene demonstrates the power of JavaScript tool-based procedural generation:

PROCEDURALLY GENERATED STRUCTURES:

1. SPIRAL TOWER (Physics - 96 spheres)
   - 12 levels with 8 spheres each
   - Decreasing radius as it goes up
   - Color gradient from bottom to top
   - All physics-enabled with collision

2. 3-RING ORBITAL SYSTEM (Non-Physics - 36 spheres)
   - 3 concentric rings at different heights
   - 12 objects per ring
   - Different orbital speeds per ring
   - Custom animation code for each object

3. WAVE FIELD (Non-Physics - 100 cylinders)
   - 10x10 grid of animated cylinders
   - Sine wave propagation based on distance
   - Dynamic scaling and height
   - Color gradient across grid

4. FIBONACCI SPIRAL (Non-Physics - 50 spheres)
   - Golden ratio angle distribution
   - Spherical arrangement
   - Size gradient (larger at top)
   - Each with unique rotation speed

5. PENDULUM ARRAY (Physics - 16 objects)
   - 8 pendulums with increasing lengths
   - Alternating initial velocities
   - Spring constraints
   - Synchronized wave motion

6. HEXAGONAL GRID (Physics - 37 cylinders)
   - Honeycomb pattern using hex coordinates
   - 3-ring hexagonal arrangement
   - Color based on distance from center
   - All physics-enabled

7. ROTATING TORUS RING (Non-Physics - 288 spheres)
   - Mathematical torus surface
   - 24 major segments, 12 minor segments
   - Continuous rotation animation
   - Color gradient along major axis

TOTAL OBJECT COUNT: 600+ objects
- ~150 physics objects
- ~450+ non-physics animated objects
