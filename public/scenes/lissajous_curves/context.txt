# Lissajous Curves

5 spheres tracing beautiful 3D Lissajous curves with different frequency ratios.

## What are Lissajous Curves?

Complex harmonic motion patterns created by combining sine waves with different frequencies in X, Y, and Z axes.

Named after Jules Antoine Lissajous (1822-1880), French physicist.

## Curves in This Demo

1. **Red (1:2:3)** - Simple harmonic
2. **Green (2:3:5)** - Complex path
3. **Blue (3:4:2)** - Figure-8 variants
4. **Yellow (5:3:4)** - Dense pattern
5. **Magenta (4:5:3)** - Intricate weave

## Mathematical Form

```
x(t) = A * sin(a * t)
y(t) = B * sin(b * t)
z(t) = C * sin(c * t)
```

Where `a:b:c` is the frequency ratio.

## Animation Code

```javascript
mesh.position.x = 8 * Math.sin(a * time);
mesh.position.y = 5 + 8 * Math.sin(b * time);
mesh.position.z = 8 * Math.sin(c * time);
mesh.rotation.y = time; // Spin for visual interest
```

## Physics Connection

Lissajous curves represent systems with multiple periodic forces:
- Coupled oscillators
- Wave interference patterns
- Orbital mechanics
- Signal processing (oscilloscope patterns)

## Try This

Create your own curve with new frequency ratio:
```javascript
{a: 7, b: 5, c: 3, color: '#00ffff'}
```

The more coprime the numbers, the more complex the pattern!
