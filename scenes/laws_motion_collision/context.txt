Theory:
Newton's Laws of Motion form the foundation of classical mechanics:
1. First Law (Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.
2. Second Law: F = ma (Force equals mass times acceleration)
3. Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Explanation:
This scene demonstrates elastic collisions between two spheres. When ball 1 (moving) collides with ball 2 (stationary), momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. The outcome depends on the mass ratio between the objects.

In an elastic collision:
- Total momentum before = Total momentum after (m₁v₁ᵢ + m₂v₂ᵢ = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f)
- Total kinetic energy before = Total kinetic energy after (½m₁v₁ᵢ² + ½m₂v₂ᵢ² = ½m₁v₁f² + ½m₂v₂f²)

The restitution coefficient determines how "bouncy" the collision is. A value of 1 means perfectly elastic (no energy loss), while 0 means perfectly inelastic (maximum energy loss).

Facts:
- In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved
- The coefficient of restitution (e) ranges from 0 to 1
- When equal masses collide elastically, they exchange velocities
- If a light object hits a heavy stationary object, the light object bounces back
- If a heavy object hits a light stationary object, both move forward
- Real-world collisions are never perfectly elastic
- Newton's Third Law: During collision, each ball exerts equal and opposite forces on the other

Key Equations:
- Conservation of momentum: m₁v₁ᵢ + m₂v₂ᵢ = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f
- Conservation of energy: ½m₁v₁ᵢ² + ½m₂v₂ᵢ² = ½m₁v₁f² + ½m₂v₂f²
- Coefficient of restitution: e = (v₂f - v₁f)/(v₁ᵢ - v₂ᵢ)
- Final velocities (elastic): v₁f = ((m₁-m₂)v₁ᵢ)/(m₁+m₂), v₂f = (2m₁v₁ᵢ)/(m₁+m₂)
