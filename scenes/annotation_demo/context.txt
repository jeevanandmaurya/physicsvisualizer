# Visual Annotation Demo Scene

This scene demonstrates the new Visual Annotation System capabilities:

## Features Shown

1. **Text Annotations**
   - Speed labels (real-time velocity magnitude)
   - Position coordinates
   - Kinetic energy display
   - Mass labels

2. **Vector Annotations**
   - Velocity vectors (arrows showing direction and magnitude)
   - Scaled to be visible but not overwhelming
   - Different colors for different objects

3. **Dynamic Updates**
   - All annotations update in real-time
   - Text refreshes at 30 Hz
   - Vectors update every frame

4. **Conditional Visibility**
   - Some annotations only show when object is moving (`minSpeed` threshold)
   - Prevents clutter when objects are stationary

## Objects

- **Projectile** (Orange sphere): Launched with initial velocity, demonstrates parabolic motion
- **Box** (Green box): Starts at rest, will interact with projectile
- **Ground** (Gray): Static platform

## What to Observe

1. Watch the **speed label** change as the projectile moves
2. See the **velocity vector** (blue arrow) showing direction of motion
3. **Position coordinates** update as objects move
4. **Kinetic energy** changes with speed
5. After collision, both objects show their respective velocities

## Customization

You can modify the annotations in the scene JSON:
- Change colors, sizes, positions
- Add/remove annotation types
- Adjust update frequencies
- Modify visibility conditions

See `src/core/visuals/README.md` for full documentation.
