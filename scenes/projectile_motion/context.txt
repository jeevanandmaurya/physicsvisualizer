Theory:
Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to acceleration due to gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory.

Explanation:
When an object is launched at an angle, it follows a parabolic path. This motion can be analyzed by breaking it into two components:
- Horizontal motion: uniform velocity (no acceleration in the absence of air resistance)
- Vertical motion: uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity

The range, maximum height, and time of flight depend on the initial velocity and launch angle. For a given initial speed, the maximum range is achieved at a 45° launch angle.

Facts:
- At the highest point of the trajectory, the vertical velocity is zero
- The horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the flight (ignoring air resistance)
- The time taken to reach maximum height equals the time taken to fall back down
- The trajectory is symmetric about the vertical line through the highest point
- Maximum range occurs at 45° launch angle (for level ground)
- The path followed is a parabola

Key Equations:
- Horizontal distance: x = v₀ₓ × t
- Vertical distance: y = v₀ᵧ × t - ½gt²
- Time of flight: T = 2v₀sin(θ)/g
- Maximum height: H = v₀²sin²(θ)/(2g)
- Range: R = v₀²sin(2θ)/g
